# Run the Tier 2 integration tests under coverage.
#
# covr::package_coverage() executes the test suite in a *separate* R session
# (via callr) whose environment is built from rcmd_safe_env() and therefore
# does NOT inherit the NOT_CRAN variable set at the CI job level. The
# integration tests guard on skip_on_cran(), so under covr they all skip and
# their code (the estimator pipelines, gradients, .adirmcPhaseLoop, the
# plot.admFit panels, ...) is reported as uncovered. That is why coverage sat
# at ~77% even after NOT_CRAN was added to test-coverage.yaml in #75 — the env
# var was set on the covr driver process, not the session that runs the tests.
#
# covr DOES export R_COVR=true into that session, so detect it here and turn
# NOT_CRAN on from inside the process where the tests actually run. This only
# affects coverage runs:
#   * local devtools::test() already sets NOT_CRAN -> integration tests run
#   * R CMD check runs them via rcmdcheck's default NOT_CRAN=true
#   * plain testthat::test_dir() (R_COVR unset) is unaffected -> Tier 2 skips
